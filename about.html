    <p>Hi!</p>
    <p>Im Delia Medrano, finishing my last semester of undergrad in psychology with a minor in Hispanic 
        Studies, and Ill be starting my MA in psychology this coming spring. Im particularly interested in developmental 
        psychology and working with children, exploring how they grow, learn, and develop over time. 
        I love connecting what I learn in the classroom to real-world situations. </p>
        
    <p>I studied abroad in Spain during my junior year, which gave me first-hand experience navigating new environments 
        and becoming more independent. </p>

    <p>Outside of class, I work part-time at Starbucks. I also enjoy exploring new experiences and collecting trinkets 
        like Sonny Angels and Jellycats. I look forward to creating new memories and continuing to grow both personally 
        and professionally.</p>
